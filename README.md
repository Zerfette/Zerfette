## ‚ù§Ô∏è My favorite project
[nx-sudoku-multiframework](https://github.com/Zerfette/nx-sudoku-multiframework)

This "Sudoku" repository uses Nx, a powerful monorepo tool, to manage Sudoku applications across JavaScript frameworks like React, Solid, Vue, and Svelte, promoting code reusability and efficient development. It features a modular core package for framework-agnostic reuse, functional programming principles for code clarity, and Tailwind CSS for consistent styling. The project also includes a dynamic confetti effect with P5, adding a celebratory touch to the applications.
